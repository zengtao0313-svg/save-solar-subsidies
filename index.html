    <p>
      Florida is ending subsidies for solar panels that help small businesses and low-income residents.
      These programs are essential for promoting clean energy, lowering energy bills, and creating local green jobs.
      We urge the government to extend these programs to ensure solar energy is accessible to all Floridians.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <img src="images/clean_energy.jpg" alt="Clean Energy" class="inline-image">

      <ul>
        <li>Reduce carbon emissions and move Florida toward a cleaner, more resilient energy future</li>
        <li>Lower energy bills for small businesses, nonprofits, and working families</li>
        <li>Help low-income communities access renewable energy that was previously unaffordable</li>
        <li>Protect residents from rising utility bills caused by fossil fuel price volatility</li>
        <li>Create high-paying local clean-energy jobs across installation, maintenance, and manufacturing</li>
        <li>Support energy independence during hurricanes and outages with rooftop solar + battery storage</li>
        <li>Prevent Florida from falling behind other states accelerating renewable energy adoption</li>
        <li>Ensure federal clean energy programs actually reach Florida families instead of going unused</li>

      <h2>What’s Happening in Florida</h2>

      <img src="images/florida_power_lines.jpg" alt="Florida energy policy" class="inline-image">

      <p>
        Florida's solar future is at risk. Several recent policy decisions at both the state and federal levels 
        have reduced or eliminated financial incentives that helped homeowners, condo residents, and small 
        businesses go solar. Most notably:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The cancellation of a <strong>$156 million federal Solar for All grant</strong>, which was intended to help low-income Floridians install solar panels</li>
        <li>Proposals to end or weaken federal tax credits that made home solar affordable nationwide</li>
        <li>Local-level pressure to reduce net-metering benefits, making rooftop solar less economical</li>
        <li>The expiration of the 30% federal solar tax credit in 2025, unless Congress extends it</li>
        <li>The lack of state-level incentives compared to other states, leaving Florida residents with fewer options</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Without action, these changes will disproportionately harm low-income households, renters, condo owners, 
        and small businesses who rely on subsidies to access renewable energy. Solar should not be only for wealthy 
        households — it must remain accessible to everyone.
