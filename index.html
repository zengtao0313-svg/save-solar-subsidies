    <h1>Save Solar Subsidies in Florida</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Florida is ending subsidies for solar panels that help small businesses and low-income residents.
      These programs are essential for promoting clean energy, lowering energy bills, and creating local green jobs.
      We urge the government to extend these programs to ensure solar energy is accessible to all Floridians.

    <!-- WHAT'S HAPPENING -->
    <section>
      <h2>What’s Happening in Florida</h2>
      <p>
        Florida’s solar future is uncertain. Recent policy changes at the federal and state level have 
        reduced or eliminated key incentives that helped homeowners, condo residents, and small businesses install solar.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>$156 million Solar for All grant canceled</strong>, removing support for low-income households</li>
        <li>Federal tax credits may be weakened or allowed to expire in 2025</li>
        <li>Utilities have pushed to weaken net-metering payments for solar owners</li>
        <li>Florida offers fewer state-level solar incentives compared to other states</li>
        <li>Multifamily housing and small businesses face higher upfront costs with no support</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Without action, these changes will harm vulnerable communities and slow Florida’s progress toward a clean energy future.
